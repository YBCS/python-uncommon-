# Hello-World
start of a journey.


hey there! This is my first branch edit of my read me file
I have a message for other students:
  To learn something, you must teach.
  
And so the the first step is taken.

I my github profile, I want to share my experience as I learn so that my profile can help others when they need help as they start completely new on the path as a programmer.

I am not skilled enough, yet, but i'll do my best as a mentor and student!
